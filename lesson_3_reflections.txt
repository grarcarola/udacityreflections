When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is good when you want to share with others and also it will prevent data loss if you damage or lose
your PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So no files change without you knowing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are good when you want to edit and work on existing files on someones github.
Clones are good for working on something locally.
Branches are good for creating a new part for a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you can work on it locally and not have to merge or pull/fetch and potentially fix
a merge error.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Without using Git or Github collaboration is difficult. You would need to be in the 
same room to work on files and it would be hard to compare any changes. Git and Github 
make it much easier to view changes, merge work, and collaborate with people anywhere.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

When you are working on a live project and are not ready to send out a new product or 
if you are working on a new feature or bug fix.
