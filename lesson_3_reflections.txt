When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is good when you want to share with others and also it will prevent data loss if you damage or lose
your PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So no files change without you knowing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are good when you want to edit and work on existing files on someones github.
Clones are good for working on something locally.
Branches are good for creating a new part for a project.
